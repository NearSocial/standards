## Schema description

- **`bold`** means the key is required.
- _`italic`_ means the key is optional.
- `[account_id]` means the dynamic key is an account ID. For example, `alex.near` as a key. It usually used to create some edge towards that account.
- `""` means the empty key. It's used when the entity has both the string value and the object (e.g. a Widget)

## Root schema

**[Each account should follow the Root schema](./types/Root.md)**

## TBD:
- Status update/Post
- Images with IPFS and Arweave.
